<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an Amazon AWS Robo Advisor application that provides investment portfolio recommendations for retirement plans to both existing and potentially new customers, based on client input.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples. -->

* [Amazon Lex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/what-is.html)
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<!-- This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->
* Read through the AWS documentation for setting up AWS Lex and Lambda

* You can watch the videos also to see the settings for the Bot and the dialog scripts. The videos can also walk you through how to query the Bot. The demo videos are located in the [resources](https://github.com/avangelinac/lambda_function) folder

* You will need to follow AWS instructions on how to set up a Lex Bot for a Confirmation Prompt demo and then for a Lambda Function Demo.

* I have placed Comments throughout the code so that you can follow the Lambda code and be able to replicate the app on your own. Also, so that you're able to contribute in the future :-)

### Prerequisites

<!-- This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. -->
A text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
